GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Genre: Fantasy platformer with procedural generation
Platform: PC, consoles
Number of players: 1
Mode: Single-player campaign

GAMEPLAY REQUIREMENTS
2.1. Basic mechanics
Control a single character who can manipulate gravity.
Movement and falling physics are tied to the gravity vector.
"Vaults of the Abyss" system (inventory for key items and resources).
Magnetization mechanic for certain platforms (magnetic gravity interaction).

2.2. Gravity system
Gravity engine requirements:

Instant redirection of the player's gravity vector.

Recalculation of the new "support surface" when gravity is changed.

Correct rendering of the world and UI for any gravity vector.

Visual indicators for areas where gravity change is disabled.

Gravity control types:

Local Gravity: Standard ability. The player "falls" toward the nearest surface in the chosen direction (Up / Down / Left / Right).

Inertial Gravity: After a vector change the player retains some inertia from previous movement, enabling long launches/throws.

Magnetic Gravity: Allows temporary "sticking" to specific metal platforms, overriding the global gravity vector.

2.3. Artificial Intelligence
Enemy behavior (Guardians of the Ruins):

Patrol along predefined routes tied to their gravity orientation.

React to visual detection of the player within their gravity plane.

Search for the player at the last known position.

Cannot change gravity themselves, but can use fixed/stationary transitions.

AI states:

Patrol: Move along a set cycle.

Alert: Increase movement speed and widen view angle when the player is suspected.

Pursuit: Direct chase of the player within the AI’s gravity plane.

Search: Investigate the last known player location for a limited time.

CHARACTER SYSTEM
3.1. Keeper (main character)
Abilities:

Heart of the Abyss (Primary ability): Instant change of the personal gravity vector.

Abyssal Gaze: Brief time dilation to assess the situation and precisely select a gravity vector (limited charge).

Inversion Jump: Short teleport-like lunge in the direction opposite to current gravity for quick evasion.

Sense of Gravity: Passive ability that highlights the contours of platforms in the direction of the current gravity vector.

Limitations:

Cannot attack directly; can only dodge and use the environment.

Gravity-change ability has a short cooldown.

Some Stagnant Magic zones block the use of abilities.

RESOURCE AND UPGRADE SYSTEM
4.1. Resource types

Abyssal Essence: Restores charges for Abyssal Gaze and Inversion Jump.

Shards of Time: Permanent stat upgrades (cooldown reduction, increased slow duration).

Ancient Runes: Unlock new abilities (for example, Magnetic Gravity).

Spatial Keys: Single-use items to activate portals and special mechanisms.

4.2. Ability upgrades
Available upgrades:

Accelerated Recovery: Reduces gravity-change cooldown.

Increased Capacity: Raises the maximum charge for Abyssal Gaze.

Chain Inversion: Allows two gravity changes in mid-air without touching a surface.

Stable Attraction: Grants immunity to the effects of gravitational vortices.

LEVEL DESIGN
5.1. Level structure

Procedurally assembled from cubic "Sectors": each sector is a cube with platforms, obstacles and enemies on all six faces.

Non-linear progression: the player may choose which face of a sector to move through.

Mandatory gravity puzzles: progression requires using gravity changes in a specific sequence.

Hidden zones: secret rooms accessible only via advanced gravity techniques.

5.2. Gravity zones

Stable Gravity Zones: standard sectors.

Chaotic Gravity Zones: sectors where the gravity vector randomly changes for the player at set intervals.

Stagnant Magic Zones: block ability use, leaving only the basic jump.

Gravity Vortices: move the player in a random direction on contact.

USER INTERFACE
6.1. HUD elements

Current Vector Indicator: an arrow in the center of the screen that always shows the character's "down" direction.

Ability Charge Indicator: displays charge levels for Abyssal Gaze and Inversion Jump.

Cooldown Indicator: visual countdown until the next gravity change is available.

Spatial mini-map: a 3D schematic map showing the outline of the current sector and adjacent sectors.

6.2. Visual effects

Gravity Shift Effect: smooth dimming/brightening of the screen and HUD reorientation when gravity changes.

Sense of Gravity visualization: highlights active platforms within the field of view.

Distortion shaders: edge-screen effects when in Chaotic Gravity zones.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
7.1. Graphics

Support dynamic reorientation of camera and lighting.

Particle system for gravity-change and teleportation effects.

Shaders to visualize gravitational fields and "forbidden" zones.

Post-processing to create a surreal, weightless atmosphere.

7.2. Performance

Maintain stable 120 FPS during rapid camera changes and with complex level geometry.

Optimize collision calculations for arbitrary gravity vectors.

Efficient memory usage for procedural generation and streaming/loading of sectors.

SAVING AND PERSISTENCE
8.1. Save system

Checkpoints (Stability Anchors): player-activated points that save progress.

Persistent collectible saves: found runes and shards are saved permanently.

Random level seed: ability to save and share a seed to reproduce a specific generated level.

Run statistics: record time, number of deaths, and number of gravity changes used.
